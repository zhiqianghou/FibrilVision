# FibrilVision

## Description
An automated software for analyzing transmission electron microscope images of cross-sectioned materials with fibril structures. The software extracts fibril length and density and generates an interactive dashboard to visualize data trends over time with customizable daily or weekly updates.

## Features
- Import images from customer's AWS cloud database
- Image processing using computer vision techniques
- Extract fibril length and density from 50,000X magnification images
- NLP to obtain lot number from file names
- Interactive dashboard for data visualization with daily or weekly updates
